(Reuters) - President Barack Obama charged back onto the campaign trail on Friday and faced a withering attack from Republican rival Mitt Romney over disappointing new U.S. jobs numbers as the candidates sought to emphasize their differences in states crucial to the battle for the White House.

Just hours after basking in his supporters' adulation at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama was hit by a stark reminder of the challenge he faces convincing voters to give him a second term despite stubbornly high unemployment on his watch.

As the candidates launched the final two-month drive to Election Day, the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Obama getting at least a small bounce from his convention, taking a narrow lead of 46 percent to Romney's 44 percent among likely voters. Romney previously led by 45 percent to Obama's 44 percent.

The latest polling was conducted before the Labor Department reported on Friday that U.S. employers added a lower-than-expected 96,000 jobs in August - which could ensure that any "bump" in popular support for Obama is limited and brief.

The grim economic news dimmed the afterglow from the convention where Obama on Thursday night accepted his party's nomination and appealed to Americans for more time and patience to finish his economic agenda.

Pouncing on the jobs data to slam Obama's handling of the economy - the top concern of voters - Romney called the figures "another disappointing, sad report."

Romney said that Obama "just doesn't know what it takes to get America strong again. And I do. And I'm going to bring it back," Romney said at a rally.

While noting the private sector had now generated jobs for 30 straight months, Obama acknowledged: "It's not good enough. We need to create more jobs faster."

At the same time, he pointed out that Republicans in Congress had blocked much of his jobs plan and accused Romney of making promises to revitalize the economy but not telling voters how he would do it.

"I honestly believe this is the clearest choice that we've had in my lifetime," Obama said at a later rally. "It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of our future, where America goes."

Obama took to the campaign trail with his wife, Michelle, and Vice President Joe Biden and his wife a day after his nationally televised acceptance speech capped two weeks of back-to-back nominating conventions for Democrats and Republicans.

Obama's acceptance speech drew the largest television audience of this year's political conventions and ranked as the biggest political moment ever on social media site Twitter.

The end of the conventions opened the last phase of a White House battle that polls show is essentially deadlocked amid deep voter anxiety about the economy.

BACK TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL

The latest jobs data could give a boost to Romney, the former head of a private equity firm who has made his business experience the centerpiece of his campaign.

He argues he is uniquely qualified to create job growth and says Obama is not up to the job. The Obama campaign has sought to undermine Romney's argument by pointing out some firms he invested in ended up cutting jobs or shipping them overseas.

Obama, who entered office during the darkest days of the 2007-2009 recession, has brought unemployment down from a peak of 10 percent in his first year, but has been unable to crack the 8 percent barrier - a fact that Romney's camp has stressed.

"This is not even close to what a recovery looks like," Paul Ryan, Romney's vice presidential running mate, told CNBC.

Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the Romney-Ryan approach was not the answer, saying that would mean "going back to the same policies that led us to the crisis that we've been going through to begin with."

The unemployment data still raise doubts whether Obama will get anything more than a limited - and short-lived boost - from the convention.

Obama senior adviser David Plouffe sought to play down expectations, saying he did not expect any major shift in voter sentiment. "We come out of the convention with momentum. That doesn't mean the race is going to change significantly," he told reporters traveling with Obama.

SWING-STATE TOUR

Obama and Romney campaigned on Friday in the toss-up states of New Hampshire and Iowa, which could be critical to piecing together the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.

They are among eight to 10 battleground states that are likely to decide the election, a list that also includes Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and Wisconsin.

Those states have been flooded by tens of millions of dollars in TV ads by the campaigns, and hundreds of millions more from outside groups allied with the two candidates.

Obama is spending the weekend on a bus tour of Florida, while Romney heads to Virginia for campaign events on Saturday.

Obama dismissed Romney and Ryan as foreign policy neophytes and mocked the Republican nominee for offending British leaders by criticizing London's handling of the Olympic Games while on an overseas trip there.

Seeking to turn the tables on Obama, Romney said on Friday he had only been speaking to the British in a straightforward way, and faulted the president for what he said was a failure to talk tough enough with China about trade and currency practices.

"The message from last night was that the president's plan is four more years of the four last years. And I don't think the American people want four more years of the four last years," Romney said.

Democrats said they were pleased with the three-day convention, which they say could help reignite supporters' enthusiasm.

The next big event on the political calendar is the first of three presidential debates on October 3 in Denver.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H. — The hustings of the campaign trail replaced the hoopla of party conventions Friday, with an imploring President Obama and a buoyant Mitt Romney crossing paths in the small but potentially decisive swing states of New Hampshire and Iowa.

“New Hampshire, I need you to make some phone calls for me. New Hampshire, I need you to knock on some doors for me,’’ Obama urged an enthusiastic crowd of about 6,000 spectators on the grounds of the Strawbery Banke Museum near downtown Portsmouth. “New Hampshire, I need you to tell your friends and neighbors and co-workers what’s at stake in this election.”

The urgency of the appeal signaled the closeness of the presidential race after the Democrats wrapped up their Charlotte convention. Building on some of the themes from his speech Thursday and adopting a “we can do this together” mentality, Obama sought to rally supporters and draw clear-cut distinctions in policies and philosophy with Romney, his Republican rival. Portsmouth was Obama’s first stop after the convention.

After the midday speech, he traveled to another event in ­Iowa, where Romney began his day. The GOP presidential candidate focused on the soft economy, evidenced by a lackluster jobs report released Friday, in his stop in heavily Republican western Iowa.


“This president tried, but he didn’t understand what it takes to make our economy work. I do,’’ the former Massachusetts governor told 4,000 supporters at Northwest College in Orange City. Later, at an outdoor rally before a boisterous crowd at Holman Stadium in Nashua, Romney made reference to Obama’s speech Thursday, saying he was disappointed that it was loaded with more promises after Obama did not fulfill his promises from 2008.

‘‘He said he'd create jobs,’’ Romney declared. ‘‘And instead we have unemployment still over 8 percent for 43 straight months.

“Those are real people,’’ said the former head of the private equity firm Bain Capital, driving home the crux of his campaign message. “Those are not just numbers.’’

The dueling events in New Hampshire and Iowa, better known as the first primary and caucus states, revealed how the small states with a total of 10 electoral votes have emerged as critical pieces in both candidates’ paths to 270 and victory. The two join roughly eight other states, among them Florida, Ohio, and Colorado, that are expected to determine who will be the nation’s next leader.

The Romney campaign released a barrage of ads on Friday tailored to the economic needs and struggles of each of those states. The Obama campaign may rise or fall on the strength of a sophisticated voter contact and ground organization it has been building for five years.

Friday’s rally in Portsmouth with Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and his wife, Jill, was part of that exercise, not only in the president’s exhortations for supporters to join the effort but also in the heavy presence of campaign staff and volunteers working to get contact information from those in attendance.

Obama sought to make the election more of a decision that decides the future path of the nation rather than a referendum on the past, particularly on his presidency.

“Now that both sides have made their argument, there’s a big choice to make. And I honestly believe this is the biggest choice, the clearest choice, of any time in our generation,” Obama said during about a 28-minute speech, adding that it was “a choice between two different paths for America . . . two fundamentally different visions for how we move forward.”

Romney and the GOP, Obama said, want to turn back the clock at the expense of the middle class, a constituency he mentioned repeatedly.

“My opponent says he wants to reduce the deficit, too,” Obama said. “There’s a basic component missing from his plan, math . . . arithmetic.”

Obama said Republicans have not revealed the details of their tax-and-spending cuts plan because there are “only a few ways of doing it and most of them involve sticking it to the middle class.”

Invoking the fiscal policies of President Clinton that helped produce 23 million new jobs, Obama repeated his refrain that he would raise taxes only on those making more than $250,000 a year.

The Republicans are recycling the same economic plans they have pushed for the past three decades, he said.

“Tax cuts, tax cuts, gut some regulations . . . oh, and more tax cuts,” he said to an enthusiastic crowd.

“We have been there. We’ve tried that. It didn’t work then; it’s not going to work now,” Obama said.

At his rally in Nashua, Romney ridiculed the Democrats for initially leaving the term “God” out of its convention platform,pointing out that such references were part of the living documents of America since the Declaration of Independence. Democrats were assailed for not having any references to God, as well as dropping a line that referred to Jerusalem as the historic and present capital of Israel.

Democrats changed the platform to include both after prodding from Obama.

At his stop in Portsmouth, Obama injected a personal touch, noting, almost wistfully, a conversation he had just had with Governor John Lynch, who introduced him.

“I was telling John that I will always have great memories of Portsmouth,” Obama said, “because one of the things that happens as you’re running for president is the bubble starts closing in on you, so I remember some of the last places where I got to take a walk around with nobody around.

“And Portsmouth, in 2007, was one of those places,” he recalled. “It was a gorgeous day, like today. And I actually — we walked and we came right down here,” he said, pointing past the museum fencing toward the waterfront. “And there was a theater, an improv thing going on. And I sat there, and I think — I might have bought some ice cream,” he said with a grin that elicited laughter from the crowd.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Clint Eastwood confirmed in an interview with his hometown newspaper that he was winging it last week when — unscripted and unvetted — he addressed the Republican National Convention.
The resulting loss for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney didn’t stem from what Eastwood said (an American movie icon chatting with an empty chair worked for some people), but from what the Republican presidential hopeful gave up.

Those 12 minutes of prime-time television, with an audience of 30 million people, will not be coming back, at least not too many times. The precious time could have been so much better spent, as the Democrats and President Obama proved on the last night of their convention here Thursday.

Just before Obama’s acceptance speech (time which the GOP had used a week prior for Eastwood's unfocused ramble), the incumbent’s campaign broadcast seven minutes of highly produced, smartly edited video.

Longtime Republican political consultant Steve Schmidt, who ran John McCain’s campaign four years ago, had earlier remarked that the Democrats could not have made a stronger case for the president. And the video reinforced that contention.

Yes, the Democratic video was propaganda. But that did not stop almost all the major television outlets, including right-tilting Fox News, from showing some or all of it. Only CBS News preferred to go with commentary from its analysts, rather than content the producers at the network said they considered an advertisement.

Most television viewers at home, therefore, saw the video and a brief introduction by First Lady Michelle Obama, leading seamlessly into the president’s nomination acceptance speech.

The Eastwood intro, in contrast, had left many people buzzing about the movie actor and what exactly he had in mind with his monologue to an invisible President Obama. Was he resurrecting an old vaudeville routine?

The Democratic convention video accomplished many things — including positioning Obama as part of a legacy of leaders taking charge during tough times. Images of Pearl Harbor, the Great Depression, the Twin Towers after Sept. 11 melded with shots of the Wall Street panic of 2008 and the long job lines that have followed.

George Clooney provided the voice over and testimonials came from three top surrogates — Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and former President Bill Clinton.

Michelle Obama told how her husband is up until 1 or 2 a.m. each night, studying briefing books and reading letters from the American people. Clinton described how Obama went after healthcare reform,  knowing the "horrible consequences” politically, because he wanted to lift the heavy burden of high medical bills from average people. Biden talked about the president’s “ramrod spine” in making the call to send Navy SEALs after Osama bin Laden, when some of his advisors weren’t sure.

The piece reached an emotional crescendo with Clooney — speaking over pictures of hard working Americans — talking about how we have all endured tough times together.

“We have a long way to go,” the actor said, “but with every new beginning, every homecoming, every step forward, we remember who we are." Obama ended the video describing the “incredible gift” he gets, every day, working for the American people.

The unmistakable, but unspoken, message to the more than 35 million people who tuned in during the prime-time television hour: "You can’t let me go now; we’ve been through so much together. And things are going to get better any day now.”

Romney’s team also produced a slick, winning video, not terribly unlike the one by Obama’s handlers. The difference: it played out of prime time and went unseen by most Americans.Team Romney, instead, offered up an ornery Eastwood, playing himself, and connecting most deeply with an empty seat.

WASHINGTON — Finally, the fall season offers the matchup sure to attract the biggest audience of the campaign: President Barack Obama goes one-on-one with Republican rival Mitt Romney in three prime-time debates.

Typically the top political draw in the final sprint to Election Day, the debates assume outsized importance this year with the race a dead heat. The two polished candidates will have their sound bites and rhetoric down cold so any slip or inadvertent move – like President George H.W. Bush's exasperated glance at his watch or Democrat Al Gore's repeated sighing – could roil the campaign for days and linger in voters' mind until Nov. 6.

No wonder Romney spent days this past week holed up at the Vermont estate of former Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey for debate practice sessions with Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who played the role of Obama. The president, for his part, has had one practice session with Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, the Democrats' stand-in for Romney, and is certain to have several more before the first debate Oct. 3 in Denver.

The second debate, a town hall-style session, is Oct. 16 in Hempstead, N.Y. The final debate, on foreign policy, is Oct. 22 in Boca Raton, Fla. GOP running mate Paul Ryan and Vice President Joe Biden have one debate, Oct. 11 in Danville, Ky.

Incumbents usually are at a disadvantage, defending a record against a challenger critiquing four years of work. Obama will be trying to avoid the fate of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who turned in flat debate performances in their first encounters with rivals. In the end, though, it didn't hurt either one as they both won re-election.

"Debating is a muscle that doesn't get used very often," said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor at Northeastern University and the author of "Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk TV." "Mitt Romney is better toned because he came off 20-plus primary debates. President Obama has not been on a debate stage in four years."

Debates are unique, unlike the highly choreographed campaign event or stump speech marked by over-the-top rhetoric. Schroeder said debates require a different dynamic – candidates need to be respectful, differing in opinion but avoiding any impression that it's personal.


"In 2008, the first debate between Barack Obama and John McCain, one of the takeaways was McCain did not make eye contact with Obama," Schroeder said. "That came off as rude, disrespectful."

Part of the practice sessions is figuring out when to be aggressive and how to demonstrate leadership. It's also honing the lines from months of campaign speeches as the candidates get their final opportunities to speak directly to tens of millions of voters.

In the first debate, on domestic policy, Romney and Obama will be armed with competing numbers and visions.

"We will not surrender our dreams to the failures of this president," Romney told an audience in Bedford, N.H., last December. Expect the Republican to point to 23 million Americans out of work or underemployed, a national debt now at $16 trillion and three years of an unemployment rate above 8 percent.

In a speech in April, Romney sketched out the Republican vision of smaller government, less regulation and a greater role for business.

"Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, to make our lives better, than all of the government programs put together," Romney told a meeting of the Newspaper Association of America.

Expect Obama to counter that more than 4.6 million jobs have been created since he took office after recession-driven job losses approaching 800,000 a month under Bush. In his bid to boost the middle class, the president will argue that he's reduced the typical family's federal tax burden by $3,600. And he will talk about shared responsibility and a role for government.

"As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us, together, through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government," Obama said in his convention speech.

Both will be pressed for specifics on their job creation claims. Romney promises 12 million new jobs; Obama the creation of 1 million manufacturing jobs. Neither has said how he would make those jobs happen.

The candidates are diametrically apart on health care, Medicare, gay marriage, immigration and abortion rights – all potential issues.

The second debate on Oct. 16 will cover domestic and foreign policy with questions from a group of undecided voters selected by the Gallup Organization, a format that could elicit the unusual and the memorable.

It was at a 1992 town hall debate involving President George H.W. Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot in which the Republican was caught looking at this watch. His reaction came as an audience member was talking about how much the deep recession had personally affected him. Bush, who lost that election, later said that he was thinking: "Only 10 more minutes of this crap."

The final debate Oct. 22 focuses on foreign policy, an area in which Obama has received high marks from Americans in opinion polls. The president will offer a spirited defense of his aggressive record in pursuing al-Qaida, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the collapse of Moammar Gadhafi's regime in Libya.

As for his rival, Obama said in his convention speech that Romney and Ryan are neophytes. "In a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven," the president insisted in arguing for his candidacy.

Obama said Romney and Ryan "are new to foreign policy, but from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly."

Romney has argued that Obama has "thrown Israel under a bus" and has failed to show resolve in challenging Iran and its suspected nuclear weapons program. He likely will talk about his close friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as he did in a speech to American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in March.

"In a Romney administration, there will be no gap between our nations or between our leaders," Romney told the gathering.

Expect Romney to complain about Obama cuts in projected military spending even though congressional Republicans, including his running mate Ryan, voted for them last year.
